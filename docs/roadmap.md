# Project roadmap

---

## The idea
Based on my previous prototype during my IoT thematic semester in HvA[^1], I want to build a complete weather station, featuring an embedded device with sensors, a screen and a nice-looking case and a fullstack app to operate the station and monitor the data.

## Initial status

I currently own couple basic components such as an ESP32, a breadboard, cables and some captors.  
The idea is to first define a Bill of Materials so I know what I need to buy, and then move on to coding.

After reflexion I decided to purchase the DFRobot Lark weather station as it provides a full set of weather sensors embedded into a water-resistant frame, that I can connect to my ESP32 to collect data from the sensors. 

## Roadmap

- [ ] Define BOM
- [ ] Purchase components
- [ ] Install PlatformIO
- [ ] Embedded part
- [ ] Webapp application
